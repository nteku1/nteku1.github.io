**Large Language Model Alignment**: Researching methods on ensuring responses generated by Large Language Models adhere to societal values.
 
**Communicating Classification Results over Noisy Channels**: Characterized tradeoff between latency and distortion for transmitting the results of a classifier using finite blocklength theory and uniform/lattice-based quantization.
