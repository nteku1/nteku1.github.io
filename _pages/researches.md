**Large Language Model Alignment**: Researching methods on ensuring responses generated by Large Language Models adhere to societal values.
 
**Communicating Classification Results over Noisy Channels**: Characterized tradeoff between latency and distortion for transmitting the results of a classifier using finite blocklength theory and uniform/lattice-based quantization.

**Cell-Free Networks**: Used deep learning to determine how message from a user should be decoded across access points (APs) to minimize the maximum total latency of the cell-free network.
 
**High Frequency Communications**: Researched how adaptive equalization and reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to improve transmissions made over the high frequency (HF) Band.
